# Coroutines
In order to define and understand coroutines we need first to define:<br />
1.**Function**- Refers to a **sequence** of instructions that takes input and gives output.<br />
2.**Threads**- Describes in which **context** the sequence of instructions will be executed.<br />
**Coroutines**- Refers to a concurrency design pattern that is used to simplify code that executes asynchronously.<br />
